# Design

## Color Palette

![Ethan Pitt Portfolio Site Color Palette](docs/colors.png)

The palette I am using is based [off of this space palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/06283d1363df47b5ffdff6ff), however the secondary color, #47B5FF, has been modified to #57BCFF, which allows it to pass WebAIM WCAG AAA standards on a black background while still sticking to the original theme.

## Typography

. To match the space color palette, I am using the 'Space Mono font' from Google Fonts. It is a monospace font.

. Trispace will be used for the body text. This is a sans-serif font.

## Features

The website will feature 3 pages, which are accessible from the home page via navigation links (Home, Resume and Projects). The site will also feature a downloadable copy of a CV.

* All pages will contain the following

    * A responsive navigation bar which will allow the user to traverse the site using the buttons located on top of the pages banner. 

    * A footer at the bottom of the page, which will feature a small brief about the client, a link to their CV and links to social medias (Github, Twitter, Email etc).

* Home Page

    * The home page will feature three blurbs about the client, such as a brief about the client, what their motivation is and what their goals are in the future.

* Resume

    * This page will feature a horizontal timeline for the clients work history.

    * A section about the clients skills, which will be consist of both skill graphs and written text.

* Projects

    * Two sections covering a project the client has completed as well as a project the client is going to be working on.

In the future, it is desired to add a contact page featuring a form, which users of the site can use to approach the client.


## Images

The [image](https://unsplash.com/photos/Q1p7bh3SHj8) I have chosen was picked for its simpleness, but also as it matched both the color palette and fonts I have used. It also represents a dream of wanting to do something to change the world.

## Wireframes

The Wireframes for this site can be found [here](docs/wireframes.pdf).

## Accessibility

I will aim to keep the site accessible to all users by doing the following:

* Making sure all colors contrast each other nicely and pass the [WebAIM contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) tests.

* Using Semantic HTML throughout the site.

* Ensuring Screen Readers are accounted for by including the necessary aria attributes and creating custom classes.

* Providing alternative text for any images or icons that are used.
